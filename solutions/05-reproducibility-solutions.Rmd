## cars Summary

The data give the speed of cars and the distances taken to stop. Note that the **data were recorded in the 1920s**.

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Speed/Distance Plot

As expected when plotting the relationship between speed and stopping distance, 
we see a strong correlation that a higher speed requires a longer stopping distance. 
Every 5 mph requires an additional 20 ft to stop.

```{r cars-plot, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(cars) + 
  geom_point(mapping=aes(x=speed, y=dist))
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r warning-suppression, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
warning("Testing warning suppression")
```
