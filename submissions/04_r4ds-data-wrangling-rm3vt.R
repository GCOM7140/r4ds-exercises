#' Question 1: The player tibble below is meant to record De’Andre Hunter and Kyle Guy’s dates of birth and heights. Why can’t you tidy it up with the spread() function? How could you add a new column to player to fix the problem?

#' We developed this question based on the third exercise in section 12.3.3 of R4DS. It is designed to strengthen your understanding of how spread() behaves with non-unique rows.

player <- tribble(
  ~name,             ~key,     ~value,
  #----------------/---------/-----------------------
  "De'Andre Hunter",    "dob", "December 2, 1997",
  "De'Andre Hunter", "height", 201,
  "De'Andre Hunter",    "dob", "August 11, 1997",
  "Kyle Guy",           "dob", "August 11, 1997",
  "Kyle Guy",        "height", 191
)

#' two diff. obsverations for De'Andres DOB

player %>% 
  group_by(name, key) %>% 
  mutate(keep = row_number()) %>% 
  spread(key, value) %>% 
  filter(keep == 1)

#' Question 2: Do you need to gather or spread preg (see below) to tidy it? What variables does preg include?

preg <- tribble(
  ~pregnant, ~male, ~female,
  #--------/------/---------
  "yes",        NA,      10,
  "no",         20,      12
)

#' preg=gather because values are names 

preg %>% 
  gather(`male`, `female`, key = "gender", value = "count")

#' Question 3: How would you explain the warning message below in layman’s terms to someone who couldn’t figure out what it means? Suppose they want to make sure that every piece of the tibble makes its way into the result of the separate() function call. What could they do to remedy the situation?

tibble(x = c("a,b,c", "d,e,f,g", "h,i,j")) %>% 
  separate(x, c("one", "two", "three"))
#' extra value g was dropped 

tibble(x = c("a,b,c", "d,e,f,g", "h,i,j")) %>% 
  separate(x, c("one", "two", "three"), extra = "merge")

#' Question 4: Both separate() and unite() have a remove argument. What does it do? When does setting it to FALSE make sense?

#' Remove argument defaults to remove colums being parsed

#' Question 5: Using the who dataset, calculate the total number of cases of TB per year for China, India, and Bangladesh, then plot these statistics over time. What country-year statistics, if any, surprise you? 

who %>%
  gather(code, value, new_sp_m014:newrel_f65, na.rm = TRUE) %>% 
  mutate(code = gsub("newrel", "new_rel", code)) %>%
  separate(code, c("new", "var", "sexage")) %>% 
  select(-new, -iso2, -iso3) %>% 
  separate(sexage, c("sex", "age"), sep = 1)

who %>%
  gather(code, value, new_sp_m014:newrel_f65, na.rm = TRUE) %>% 
  mutate(code = gsub("newrel", "new_rel", code)) %>%
  separate(code, c("new", "var", "sexage")) %>% 
  select(-new, -iso2, -iso3) %>% 
  separate(sexage, c("sex", "age"), sep = 1) %>%
  group_by(country, year) %>%
  summarise(cases = sum(value)) %>%
  filter(country %in% c('China', 'India', 'Bangladesh')) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = cases, colour = country)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_line()

#' TB cases in Bangladesh are much lower than in China/India-- would not hav expected this. Also surprises me that 2009 

#' Question 6: At what wind speeds are departure delays out of NYC the longest on average?

flights %>%
  inner_join(weather, by = c("origin", "year", "month", "day", "hour")) %>%
  mutate(
    wind_speed_binned = cut_width(wind_speed, width = 5, center = 2.5)
  ) %>%
  group_by(wind_speed_binned) %>%
  summarize(dep_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = wind_speed_binned, y = dep_delay)) +
  geom_col()

#' At speeds between 30-35 mph.
