#Question 1
player %>% 
  group_by(name, key) %>% 
  mutate(keep = row_number()) %>% 
  spread(key, value) %>% 
  filter(keep == 1)

#Question 2
preg %>% 
  gather(`male`, `female`, key = "gender", value = "count")

#Question 3
#The second observation has an extra bit of information and it was dropped
tibble(x = c("a,b,c", "d,e,f,g", "h,i,j")) %>% 
  separate(x, c("one", "two", "three"), extra = "merge")

#Question 4
# The `remove` argument determines whether R should remove or keep the original
# column(s) being parsed. The default is to remove the column(s); however, it
# might make sense to keep the original column(s) for troubleshooting purposes
# or another operation in certain situations.
