# Question 1
player %>% 
  group_by(name, key) %>% 
  mutate(keep = row_number()) %>% 
  spread(key, value) %>% 
  filter(keep == 1)
# Use a "keep"

# Question 2
preg %>% 
  gather(`male`, `female`, key = "gender", value = "count")
# preg gives values as variable names. Variables are pregnant, gender, count

# Question 3
tibble(x = c("a,b,c", "d,e,f,g", "h,i,j")) %>% 
  separate(x, c("one", "two", "three"), extra = "merge")

# Question 4
# Remove says whether or not to keep the original column

# Question 5
