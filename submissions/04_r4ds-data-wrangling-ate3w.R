# Question 1
player <- tribble(
  ~name,             ~key,     ~value,
  #----------------/---------/-----------------------
  "De'Andre Hunter",    "dob", "December 2, 1997",
  "De'Andre Hunter", "height", 201,
  "De'Andre Hunter",    "dob", "August 11, 1997",
  "Kyle Guy",           "dob", "August 11, 1997",
  "Kyle Guy",        "height", 191

player %>% 
  group_by(name, key) %>% 
  mutate(keep = row_number()) %>% 
  spread(key, value) %>% 
  filter(keep == 1)

# Question 2
preg %>% 
  gather(`male`, `female`, key = "gender", value = "count")

# Preg has values for variable name

# Question 3

tibble(x = c("a,b,c", "d,e,f,g", "h,i,j")) %>% 
  separate(x, c("one", "two", "three"), extra = "merge")

# Extra value, so you need to merge

# Question 4
# Remove tells R whether or not to eliminate the column being parsed. Might be good to keep to keep track

# Question 5
who %>%
  gather(code, value, new_sp_m014:newrel_f65, na.rm = TRUE) %>% 
  mutate(code = gsub("newrel", "new_rel", code)) %>%
  separate(code, c("new", "var", "sexage")) %>% 
  select(-new, -iso2, -iso3) %>% 
  separate(sexage, c("sex", "age"), sep = 1)

who %>%
  gather(code, value, new_sp_m014:newrel_f65, na.rm = TRUE) %>% 
  mutate(code = gsub("newrel", "new_rel", code)) %>%
  separate(code, c("new", "var", "sexage")) %>% 
  select(-new, -iso2, -iso3) %>% 
  separate(sexage, c("sex", "age"), sep = 1) %>%
  group_by(country, year) %>%
  summarise(cases = sum(value)) %>%
  filter(country %in% c('China', 'India', 'Bangladesh')) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = cases, colour = country)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_line()

# The precipitous rises and falls are surprising

# Question 6
flights %>%
  inner_join(weather, by = c("origin", "year", "month", "day", "hour")) %>%
  mutate(
    wind_speed_binned = cut_width(wind_speed, width = 5, center = 2.5)
  ) %>%
  group_by(wind_speed_binned) %>%
  summarize(dep_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = wind_speed_binned, y = dep_delay)) +
  geom_col()

flights %>%
  inner_join(weather, by = c("origin", "year", "month", "day", "hour")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = wind_speed, y = dep_delay)) +
  geom_smooth()

# Delays are at their worst between 30-35
