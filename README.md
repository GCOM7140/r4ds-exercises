# r4ds-exercises
This repository includes a collection of exercises and solutions based on the
book [R for Data Science][r4ds], also known as R4DS, by [Hadley Wickham][hadley]
and [Garrett Grolemund][garrett].

## Installing the Required Packages
All of the exercises in this repository can be worked on using the tidyverse
and nycflights13 packages. You can install these packages with the following
commands:

```
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("nycflights13")
```

### Recommended Preparation
We wrote the exercises and solutions in this repository in a way that emphasizes
"tidy" data principles, the tidyverse, and other practices covered in [R for
Data Science][r4ds]. Reviewing relevant parts of R4DS carefully *before*
attempting to complete these exercises is the best way to ensure that you grow
as a data scientist through the process of working on them.

## Working on the Exercises
Below are links to the exercises in this repository. You can also find them by
navigating to the [exercises][exercises] folder of this repository and clicking
on the files ending in `.md`.

Exercises: 

 1. [Data Transformation][data transformation exercises]
 2. [Data Visualization][data visualization exercises]
 3. [Exploratory Data Analysis][eda exercises]
 4. [Data Wrangling][data wrangling exercises]
<!---
 5. [Reproducibility][reproducibility exercises]
-->

## Reviewing the Solutions
After working through these exercises, have a look at the solutions provided in
the [solutions][solutions] folder of this repository to compare your work with
the answers we developed. There are usually multiple ways to perform the same
operation in R, so don’t be concerned if your code doesn’t match what we
developed exactly. Focus instead on ensuring that your output and answers appear
to be in the same ballpark. Below are links to the solution files we developed:

Solutions: 

 1. [Data Transformation][data transformation solutions]
 2. [Data Visualization][data visualization solutions]
