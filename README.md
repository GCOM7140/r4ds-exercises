# r4ds-exercises
This repository includes a collection of exercises and solutions based on the
book [R for Data Science][r4ds], also known as R4DS, by [Hadley Wickham][hadley]
and [Garrett Grolemund][garrett].

### Installing the Required Packages
All of the exercises in this repository can be worked on using the tidyverse
and nycflights13 packages. You can install these packages with the following
commands:

```
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("nycflights13")
```

### Working on the Exercises
Below are links to the exercises in this repository. You can also find them by
navigating to the [exercises][exercises] folder of this repository and clicking
on the files ending in `.md`.

Exercises: 

 1. [Data Transformation][data transformation exercises]
 2. [Data Visualization][data visualization exercises]
 3. [Exploratory Data Analysis][eda exercises]
 4. [Data Wrangling][data wrangling exercises]
 5. [Reproducibility][reproducibility exercises]

### Reviewing the Solutions
After working through these exercises, have a look at the solutions provided in
the [solutions][solutions] folder to compare your work with the answers we
developed. There are usually multiple ways to perform the same operation in R,
so don’t be concerned if your code doesn’t match what we developed exactly.
Focus instead on ensuring that your output and answers appear to be in the same
ballpark. Below are links to the solution files we developed:

Solutions: 

 1. [Data Transformation][data transportation solutions]
 2. [Data Visualization][data visualization solutions]
 3. [Exploratory Data Analysis][eda solutions]
 4. [Data Wrangling][data wrangling solutions]
 5. [Reproducibility][reproducibility solutions]
