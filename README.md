# r4ds-exercises
A collection of exercises and solutions based on [R4DS](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html). 

### Step 1: Installing the Required Packages
All of the exercises can be solved using the `tidyverse` and `nycflights13` packages. 
You can install those packages with the following commands: 

```
install.packages('tidyverse')
install.packages('nycflights13')
```

### Step 2: Working on the Exercises
Below are links to the exercises. You can also find them by navigating to the [exercises](https://github.com/GCOM7140/r4ds-exercises/tree/master/exercises) 
folder of this repository and click on the files ending in `.md` to view. 

Exercises: 

 1. [Data Transformation](https://github.com/GCOM7140/r4ds-exercises/blob/master/exercises/01-data-transformation-exercises.md)
 2. [Data Visualization](https://github.com/GCOM7140/r4ds-exercises/blob/master/exercises/02-data-visualization-exercises.md)
 3. [Exploratory Data Analysis](https://github.com/GCOM7140/r4ds-exercises/blob/master/exercises/03-exploratory-data-analysis-exercises.md)
 4. [Data Wrangling](https://github.com/GCOM7140/r4ds-exercises/blob/master/exercises/04-data-wrangling-exercises.md)
 5. [Reproducibility](https://github.com/GCOM7140/r4ds-exercises/blob/master/exercises/05-reproducibility-exercises.md)

### Step 3: Reviewing the Solutions
After working through the exercises look at the solutions provided in the [solutions](https://github.com/GCOM7140/r4ds-exercises/tree/master/solutions) folder. 
Compare your work with what is provided. There are usually multiple ways to perform 
the same operation in R, so do not be concerned if your code does not match exactly. 
Focus on ensuring that your output and answer appears the same. Below are links to the solutions.

### Additional Resources
If you would like to review additional material while learning R4DS there are two 
great resources available: 

1. Jesse Maegan [@kierisi](https://twitter.com/kierisi) is systematically working 
through R4DS on her [blog](https://medium.com/@kierisi/r4ds-learning-to-learn-b22ffa7419f8). 
You can follow along with her as she provides more in-depth discussion into some of the R4DS topics.

2. Professor Jeffrey Arnold has provided a very comprehensive set of solutions to R4DS that 
is available at https://jrnold.github.io/r4ds-exercise-solutions/index.html
