You can install those packages with the following commands: 

```
install.packages('tidyverse')
install.packages('nycflights13')
```

### Step 3: Reviewing the Solutions
After working through the exercises look at the solutions provided in the [solutions](https://github.com/GCOM7140/r4ds-exercises/tree/master/solutions) folder. 
Compare your work with what is provided. There are usually multiple ways to perform 
the same operation in R, so do not be concerned if your code does not match exactly. 
Focus on ensuring that your output and answer appears the same. Below are links to the solutions.
